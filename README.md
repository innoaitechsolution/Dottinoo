- **Styling**: CSS Modules + CSS Variables (no Tailwind)
- **Authentication**: Supabase
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Supabase project (free tier works)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Project Settings → API
3. Copy your Project URL and anon/public key

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Set Up Supabase Database

Before testing signup, you need to create the profiles table in your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/001_profiles.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will create the `profiles` table with Row Level Security (RLS) policies that allow users to manage their own profiles.

### 5. Set Up Core Database Tables

After setting up profiles, create the core tables for classes, tasks, and assignments:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/002_core_classes_tasks.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will create the `classes`, `class_memberships`, `tasks`, and `task_assignments` tables with RLS policies and a function for joining classes by invite code.

### 6. Set Up Task Flow Tables

After setting up core tables, create the submissions table and RPC functions for task submission and review:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/003_task_flow_submissions_ai.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will create the `submissions` table with RLS policies and RPC functions for `submit_task` and `review_task`.

### 7. Set Up Storage for File Attachments

Set up Supabase Storage for file uploads in task submissions:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/004_storage_attachments.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

**Important:** If the bucket creation fails due to permissions, create it manually:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > **Storage**
2. Click **Create Bucket**
3. Name: `submissions`
4. Public: **false** (unchecked - keep it private)
5. Click **Create bucket**

This will:
- Create the `submissions` storage bucket (private)
- Add `attachment_path` column to the submissions table
- Set up RLS policies for secure file access

**Folder convention:** Files are stored as `submissions/<userId>/<assignmentId>/<filename>`

**Note:** After running the storage SQL, you may also need to update the `submit_task` RPC function. If you've already run `003_task_flow_submissions_ai.sql`, run `supabase/sql/003_task_flow_submissions_ai_update.sql` to update the function to use `attachment_path` instead of `attachment_url`.

### 8. Add Database Indexes and Validation

Add performance indexes and data validation constraints:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/005_indexes_and_validation.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will:
- Add CHECK constraints for data length validation (submissions content, task titles/instructions)
- Create indexes on frequently queried columns for better performance
- Update the `submit_task` RPC to validate content length and reject empty submissions

### 9. Set Up Automatic Profile Creation

Set up automatic profile creation from auth metadata:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/006_profile_from_auth_metadata.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will create a database trigger that automatically creates a profile when a user signs up, using the role and full_name from the signup metadata. This ensures profiles are created server-side, not from the client.

**Important:** Make sure email confirmation is enabled in your Supabase project settings (Authentication > Email Templates > Confirm signup). The profile will be created when the user confirms their email.

### 10. Fix RLS Policies for Classes

Fix Row Level Security policies to ensure teachers can view their classes:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/007_rls_fixes.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will:
- Replace the "FOR ALL" policy with explicit SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies for teachers
- Ensure teachers can SELECT their own classes (fixes "Failed to load classes" issue)
- Ensure teachers can SELECT class memberships for their classes
- Keep all existing student policies intact

**Important:** This migration fixes a critical issue where teachers cannot view classes after creating them (via demo seed or manually). Run this migration if you experience "Failed to load classes" errors.

### 11. Fix RLS Recursion Error

Fix the "infinite recursion detected in policy" error that may occur after running step 10:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/008_fix_rls_recursion.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will:
- Create SECURITY DEFINER helper functions to break circular RLS dependencies
- Replace recursive policies with non-recursive versions using helper functions
- Ensure teachers can SELECT their own classes (no recursion)
- Ensure students can SELECT classes they are members of (no recursion)
- Ensure teachers can SELECT memberships for their classes (no recursion)
- Maintain all existing permissions and least-privilege access

**Important:** If you see "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'classes'" after running step 10, run this migration immediately. The helper functions use SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS when checking cross-table relationships, breaking the recursion cycle.

### 12. Fix Task Assignments on Class Join

Ensure students who join a class after tasks exist immediately see those tasks:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/009_join_assignments_fix.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will:
- Update `join_class_by_code` RPC to create task assignments for ALL existing tasks when a student joins
- Use efficient INSERT...SELECT instead of a loop
- Add validation to ensure only students can join classes
- Return both class_id and class_name for UI confirmation

**Important:** This fixes the issue where students who join a class via invite code after tasks already exist don't see those tasks. After this migration, joining a class will automatically create task assignments for all existing tasks in that class, making tasks visible immediately on `/app/tasks`.

### 13. Add Student Profile Tags for Personalization

Add optional fields to profiles for student personalization (without sensitive medical data):

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/010_student_profile_tags.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will:
- Add `support_needs_tags` (text array) for support need tags
- Add `digital_skill_level` (text: 'starter', 'intermediate', 'advanced')
- Add `interests` (text array, optional) for student interests
- Enable teacher personalization when assigning tasks
- Support demo seed with diverse student profiles

**Important:** These fields are optional and intended for educational personalization only. They do NOT contain sensitive medical information.

### 14. Fix Student Task Listing (RPC)

Fix the student task listing bug where tasks fail to load due to RLS recursion:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/012_rpc_list_student_tasks.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will:
- Create a SECURITY DEFINER RPC function `list_student_tasks()` that returns assigned tasks
- Avoid RLS recursion issues by using a single query with JOINs
- Ensure students can only see their own assigned tasks (enforced by WHERE clause)
- Return all fields needed by the UI (status, stars_awarded, class info, etc.)

**Important:** This fixes the issue where students see "Failed to load tasks" even though task assignments exist. The RPC function bypasses RLS for the query but maintains security by filtering on `student_id = auth.uid()`.

### 15. Add Digital Skills Profiles (Personalization)

Enable teachers to set digital skills profiles for students and target tasks to specific skills:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase/sql/013_digital_skills_profiles.sql` from this repository
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will:
- Create `student_skill_profiles` table for tracking student digital skills per class
- Add `target_skill` and `target_level` columns to `tasks` table
- Set up RLS policies so teachers can manage profiles for their classes
- Allow students to view their own profiles

**Digital Skills:**
- `digital_safety`: Online safety, privacy, security
- `search_information`: Finding and evaluating information online
- `communication`: Email, messaging, professional communication
- `productivity`: File organization, tools, time management
- `ai_literacy`: Understanding and using AI tools responsibly

**Levels:**
- `beginner`: Just starting to learn
- `developing`: Making progress, needs support
- `confident`: Comfortable and independent

**Features:**
- Teachers can set skill profiles for each student in each class (via "Manage Students" on `/app/classes`)
- Teachers can optionally target tasks to specific skills/levels when creating tasks
- **Smart Suggestions**: When creating a task with target skill/level and choosing "Selected students", matching students are automatically preselected (teacher can modify)
- **Student Skill Badges**: When selecting students, teachers see each student's skill levels as small badges
- Students see skill labels on task cards when tasks are targeted
- Tasks can be assigned to whole class or selected students
- Indexes added for performance on `(class_id, target_skill)` and `(target_skill, target_level)`

**Important:** This is for educational personalization only. Skills are tracked per class because a student's skill level may vary by context or class subject.

### 16. Add Logo (Optional)

Place your Dottinoo logo at:
```
public/brand/dottinoo-logo.png
```

If the logo is missing, a placeholder with "D" will be displayed.

### 17. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
